# PHP benchmark
Simple PHP server benchmarking.

This tool can help you determine if a hosting environment is suited for your projects in terms of:
- PHP.ini settings that affect uploads;
- CPU speed available to your PHP instance;
- Disk IOPS available to your PHP instance;
- MySQL query speed;

## How to install:
    composer create-project hyperized/benchmark:dev-master
    
Copy the `/config/config.yml.example` to `/config/config.yml` and adjust to your preferences.
    
## How to run:

### Locally with CLI
    php benchmark.php

### Locally with development server

    php -S localhost:8000 benchmark.php
    
### Remotely
Install on the server by running composer and visiting the `/benchmark.php` page of the directory the project is installed at.

### Security
Note that you might want to add additional security to your server to not expose the config.yml file to your webtraffic.

For Apache with `mod_rewrite` you can use something like this in your `.htaccess` file:

    <Files "config.yml">
        deny from all
    </Files>
